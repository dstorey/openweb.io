    - Chrome, Safari, and Opera require the `-webkit-` prefix on the *value* for `match-parent`. All other values are supported prefixless at this time.
    
notes:
    – The [official Safari documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Articles/StandardCSSProperties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001266-text-align) claims `start` and `end` are supported by Safari 1. Meanwhile, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) claims they were supported from Safari 3.1. I’ve been unable to test in versions prior to Safari 4, so as the Chrome version is incorrect on MDN, I’m going to use the official figure until I can test, or get confirmation.
