	- The `-moz-` prefix is needed for Firefox 6 and above.

notes:
	- Chrome and, by extension, Opera, do not ship with hyphenation dictionaries, so while the `auto` value is parsed, no hyphenation is used when laying out the text. As such the `auto` value is listed as unsupported in those browsers. If you detect for support, it will report as supported.
