prefixes:
    - Firefox required the `-moz-` prefix on the value for `pre-wrap`, until it was supported prefixless in Firefox 3. Support for `-moz-pre-wrap` was dropped after Firefox 3.5.
    - Opera originally supported `pre-wrap` as `-pre-wrap` from Opera 4.x until 6.x. This was updated to `-o-pre-wrap` in Opera 7. The unprefixed version has been supported since Opera 8.
