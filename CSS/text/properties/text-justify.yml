    - Internet Explorer supports the `newspaper` value. This last appeared in the [14 May 2003 Candidate Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#justification-prop) version of the CSS3 Text module.
    - Internet Explorer also supports the `distribute-all-lines` value. This has not appeared in any version of the Text module, to my knowledge.
