notes:
    - Support chart not finished. Needs real data for non-IE.
    - Support denotes the property working in SVG. Need a way of showing difference between HTML/CSS and SVG
    - text-top and text-bottom are only in SVG1.0. Need way to show they're deprecated. Is it worth tracking SVG1.0 only features?
