notes:
    - Support chart not finished. Needs real data for non-IE. New values need checking
    - Need to check if `auto`, `before-edge`, and `after-edge` were renamed to `use-script`, `over-edge`, and `under-edge`
    - Support denotes the property working in SVG. Need a way of showing difference between HTML/CSS and SVG
