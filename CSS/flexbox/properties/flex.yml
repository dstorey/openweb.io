name: flex

introduced: flexbox-1

support:
    firefox: 22
    safari: [6.1]
    opera: 12.1
    chrome: [21, 29]
    ie: [10, 11]

specs:
    - flexbox-1

values:
    none:
    <flex-grow>:
    <flex-shrink>:
    <flex-basis>:

prefixes:
    - Chrome 21–28, Opera 15, and Safari 6.1+ require the `-webkit-` prefix.
    - IE 10 requires the `-ms-` prefix.

notes:
    - Older versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari support the `box-flex` property, with their relevant prefixes. However, it only supports a <number>, rather than the full range of values.
    - In the [22 March 2012](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-flexbox-20120322/#flex) version of the spec supported by IE 10, the `flex` property was not a shorthand. However, it can be used with the same values, with minor changes.
