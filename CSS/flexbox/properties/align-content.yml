prefixes:
    - Chrome 21–28, Opera 15, and Safari 6.1+ require the `-webkit-` prefix.

notes:
    - IE 10 supports the `flex-line-pack` property, with the `-ms-` prefix from an older version of the spec. The `flex-start` and `flex-end` values did not include the `flex-` prefix. The `space-between` and `space-around` properties were named `justify` and `distribute` respectively. The other values are the same as for `align-content`.
