notes:
    - Support here only refers to using `mask` with HTML. It has wider support when used with SVG.
    - Firefox only supports the `none` and `url()` from <mask-image> and only in the `mask` shorthand, not the `mask-image` property. Furthermore, it only supports SVG as a source for the mask, and not regular raster images.
