        support: none

prefixes:
    - Safari, Opera, and Chrome require the `-webkit-` prefix. The unprefixed `clip-path` property only works on SVG.

notes:
    - Support information refers to `clip-path` used with HTML. Support for `clip-path` on SVG elements is more widely supported (need to build support tables or find a way to show both)
    - Support for the differnt <basic-shape>s varies per shape. See the support table (TODO) for further details. `ellipse()` and `inset()` are not supported until Opera 21 and Chrome 34. Safari 7 only supports the `polygon()` shape.
    - Firefox currently only supports clipping using SVG embedded in the HTML document. External SVG files are not supported.
