name: text-underline-position

introduced: CSS3

specs:
	- CSS3

values:
	auto:
		support:
			ie: 6
	under:
		support:
			ie: Alt
	left:
		support:
			ie: Alt
	right:
		support:
			ie: Alt
	below:
		introduced: CSS3/Obsolete
		support:
			ie: 5.5

notes:
	- The `under` value was previously named `below`. IE supports the latter value. However, IE will place the underline on the alphabetic baseline (as specified by the dropped `alphabetic` value), instead of the under edge of the content box (i.e. doesn’t cross the descenders.)
	- In vertical writing modes, the `above` and `below` keywords supported by IE5.5 and above give the same behaviour as the current `right` and `left` keywords respectively. *I need to verify this is true*.
