notes:
    - Opera originally supported multiple shadows with a back-to-front order. This was the order specified in the abandoned CSS2 specification. This was fixed in Opera 10.5.
    - Internet Explorer supports an additional (and optional) 4th <length> representing the spread value. This matches the <length> values in `box-shadow`. However, this is currently not included in the spec.
