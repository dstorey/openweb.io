name: text-decoration

introduced: CSS1

specs:
    - CSS4
    - CSS3
    - CSS2.1
    - CSS1

values:
    <text-decoration-line>:
        support:
            firefox: 1
            safari: 1
            opera: 3.5

notes:
    - In its original form, `text-decoration` accepted the same keywords as the new `text-decoration-line` property, with the exception of the `wavy` keyword. CSS3 Text Decoration converts this property into a shorthand. If the additional values are omitted, it is backwards compatible with the original `text-decoration` specified in CSS1 and 2.
