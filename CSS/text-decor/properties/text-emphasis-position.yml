name: text-emphasis-positon

introduced: CSS3

support:
	safari: [5.1]
	opera: [15]
	chrome: [10]
	
specs:
	- CSS3

values:
	over:
	under:
	right:
	    support: none
	left:
	    support: none

prefixes:
	- The `-webkit-` prefix is needed for Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

notes:
    - The `over` and `under` keywords should be used in combination (space seperated) with the `left` or `right` keyword, however, WebKit and Blink-based browsers only accept the `over` or `under` keywords on their own. This was the behaviour last seen in the [Working Draft 5 October 2010](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-css3-text-20101005/#text-emphasis-position) version of the CSS3 Text specification.
    - For Chinese, the default position should be `under right` (or `under` in the version of the spec implemented by WebKit), but WebKit/Blink defaults to `over` for all languages.
