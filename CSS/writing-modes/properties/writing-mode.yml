        introduced: CSS3/Obsolete
        support:
            ie: 5.5

prefixes:
    - Chrome, Opera, and Safari require the `-webkit-` prefix.
    - IE optionally supports the `-ms-` prefix since version 8. This should preferably be used as the syntax has changed since implementation.

notes:
    - Internet Explorer supports a previous version of the Writing Modes specification, where the values of the writing-mode property originate from SVG 1. The latest version of the spec has different values, as supported by WebKit/Blink. However, it is trivial to map between the two versions to get the same functionality in both IE and WebKit/Blink-based browsers.
