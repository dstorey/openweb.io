name: text-orientation

introduced: CSS3

specs:
    - CSS3

values:
    mixed:
    upright:
        support:
            safari: [5.1]
            opera: [15]
            chrome: [23]
    sideways:
            safari: [6.1] (partial)
            opera: [15] (partial)
            chrome: [25] (partial)
    sideways-right:
            safari: [6.1]
            opera: [15]
            chrome: [25]
    sideways-left:
    use-glyph-orientation:

prefixes:
    - Chrome, Safari, and Opera require the `-webkit-` prefix

notes:
    - WebKit/Blink treats `sideways` as an alias for `sideways-right`. It should behave the same as `sideways-left` when using `writing-mode` with the `vertical-lr` value, but this is not supported.
    - Support was added in Safari for `upright` somewhere between 5.1.8 and 5.1.9. It does not work on Safari 5.1.7 for Windows, while it does work on Safari 5.1.9 for Mac. These are the versions that BrowserStack have available.
