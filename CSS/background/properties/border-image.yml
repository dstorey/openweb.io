prefixes:
    - Firefox 3.5–14 require the `-moz-` prefix. <border-image-slice> can not be used as part of the shorthand in these versions.
    - Safari 3–5 and Chrome ?–14 require the `-webkit-` prefix.
    - Opera 11–12.1x require the `-o-` prefix. The property was originally implemented without the prefix in Opera 10.5, before the property was changed in the spec to become a shorthand.
