name: background-clip

introduced: CSS3

support:
    firefox: 4
    safari: [4, 4.1]
    opera: 10.5
    chrome: ~4
    ie: 9

specs:
    - CSS4
    - CSS3

values:
    border-box:
    padding-box:
    content-box:
    List of <box>es:

prefixes:
    - Firefox 1 to 3.6 required the `-moz-` prefix, using the alternative values `border`, and `padding`.
    - Safari required the `-webkit-` prefix in Safari 4, using the values as they’re currently specified. Safari 3 supported the alternative values `border`, `padding` and `content`.
    
notes:
    - Firefox supported `background-clip` prefixed, and with different values from version 1 until 3.6. The `border` and `padding` values were the equivalent of the standard `border-box` and `margin-box` respectively.
    - Similarly, Safari supported `background-clip` prefixed, with the `border`, `padding`, and `content` values from version 3. The latter value mapping to `content-box`. These are still supported to this day.
    - I still need to confirm when Chrome started supporting the final syntax in both its prefixed and unprefixed forms. Safari supporting it unprefixed in version 5 maps to around the Chrome 4 time frame.
