prefixes:
    - Firefox 1–3.6 required the `-moz-` prefix. Support for <percentage>s was incorrect in these versions. Firefox 4–12 supported the prefixed version as an alias to the standard version.
    - Safari 3–4 and Chrome 1–3 required the `-webkit-` prefix.


notes:
    - Support for percentages was incorrect in Firefox prior to version 4.
    - Firefox can only display `solid` borders when using `border-radius`. Other border styles are converted to a solid line.
