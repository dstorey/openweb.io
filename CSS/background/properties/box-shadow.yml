    List of shadows:

prefixes:
    - Firefox 3.5–3.6 require the `-moz-` prefix. Firefox 4–12 continued to support the prefixed version as an alias to the standard version.
    - Safari 3–5, and Chrome 1–9 require the `-webkit-` prefix.

notes:
    - Safari and Chrome only supported 3 <length> values until Safari 4.1 and Chrome 4 respectively. The unsupported 4th <length> value is for the spread radius.
